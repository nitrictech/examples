## Nitric Examples

This repository serves as the Nitric Examples repository, housing both starter templates for the languages supported by the Nitric Framework as well as a variety of example projects to show how Nitric can be used for different use cases. 

Each example is designed to be deployed using Nitric for AWS, GCP, and Azure, or alternatively, can be run locally. The examples are organized within the [v1 directory](./v1/), which represents our latest version.

> Note: Refer to the README of each project for setup instructions and more info as sometimes they are reliant on cloud services.

## CLI Starter Templates

When utilizing the `nitric new` command to initiate a new project, the available templates listed in the `cli-templates.yaml` file are presented as options for constructing your application.

> Want another language that isn't currently available? Chat to us on [Discord](https://nitric.io/chat).

## About Nitric

[Nitric](https://nitric.io) is a framework for rapid development of cloud-native and serverless applications in many languages.

Using Nitric you define your apps in terms of the resources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs, event subscribers and scheduled jobs.

Apps built with Nitric can be deployed to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base so you can focus on your products, not your cloud provider.

Nitric makes it easy to:

- Create smart [serverless functions and APIs](https://nitric.io/docs/apis)
- Build reliable distributed apps that use [events](https://nitric.io/docs/messaging/topics) and/or [queues](https://nitric.io/docs/messaging/queues)
- Securely store, retrieve and rotate [secrets](https://nitric.io/docs/secrets)
- Read and write files from [buckets](https://nitric.io/docs/storage)
