## Project Description

This application monitors website uptime through event-driven mechanisms, utilizing APIs, scheduling, and Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication between services. When a website goes down or comes back up, it sends a Discord notification to alert users. The frontend is built with Astro/React.

## About Nitric

[Nitric](https://nitric.io) is a framework for rapid development of cloud-native and serverless applications. Define your apps in terms of the resources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs, event subscribers and scheduled jobs.

Apps built with Nitric can be deployed to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base so you can focus on your products, not your cloud provider.

Nitric makes it easy to:

- Create smart serverless functions and APIs
- Build reliable distributed apps that use events and/or queues
- Securely store and retrieve secrets
- Read and write files from buckets
